    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">A few facts about me:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            I was born in the picturesque Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia, but since the age of 17 I have considered Kyiv, the capital of our country, my home.
        </li>
        <li>
            At one time, I graduated from the Faculty of Law of Taras Shevchenko Kyiv National University and worked in this field. But as you can already tell, law is not my destination because coding is much more fun.
        </li>
        <li>
            And then I started a family with a wonderful man and became the mother of two beautiful children. I didn't stop dreaming about finally finding myself and a job that would bring me pleasure.
        </li>
        <li>
            On February 24, 2022, the lives of millions of Ukrainians were destroyed by a full-scale Russian invasion of our peaceful country. And although all of us (Ukrainians) are completely different now, because many of us have lost our homes, property, mental balance, relatives, or even our lives. For me personally, all these events became a starting point for a better future. I realized that life is too short and it should be lived to the fullest. As soon as there was an opportunity to learn in the field of front-end development, I grabbed it and here I am already making my portfolio and getting to know you.
        </li>
        <li>
            I know I don't have enough experience at this stage, but my strengths are focus, hard work, responsibility, and an absolute inability to quit halfway through. I know what I want, and I am going towards my goal - I continue to study and improve my skills, I dream of interesting projects and fruitful cooperation.
            I hope you are looking for just such a person.
